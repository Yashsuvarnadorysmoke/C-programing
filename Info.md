## Setting up c programming with VS code

Setting up C programming with Visual Studio Code involves several steps. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

1. **Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**:
   - Download and install Visual Studio Code from the official website: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. **Install the C/C++ extension**:
   - Open VS Code.
   - Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
   - Search for "C/C++" in the Extensions view search bar.
   - Click on the "Install" button for the "C/C++" extension offered by Microsoft.

3. **Install a C Compiler**:
   - You need a C compiler to compile and run your C programs. On Windows, you can use MinGW or Microsoft Visual C++. On macOS, you can use Xcode Command Line Tools or install GCC via Homebrew. On Linux, you can install GCC through your package manager.
   - For Windows, you can download and install MinGW from [MinGW Installation](http://www.mingw.org/).
   - For macOS, you can install Xcode Command Line Tools by running `xcode-select --install` in the terminal.
   - For Linux, you can install GCC using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use `sudo apt install build-essential` to install GCC.

4. **Set up PATH environment variable**:
   - For Windows, if you installed MinGW, add MinGW's `bin` directory to your PATH environment variable. Typically, this will be something like `C:\MinGW\bin`.
   - For macOS and Linux, the compiler should already be in your PATH after installation.

5. **Create a new C file**:
   - Open VS Code.
   - Create a new file by clicking on "File" > "New File" or pressing `Ctrl+N`.
   - Save the file with a `.c` extension. For example, `hello.c`.

6. **Write your C code**:
   - Write your C code in the newly created file.

7. **Compile and Run**:
   - Open a terminal in VS Code by clicking on "Terminal" > "New Terminal" or pressing `Ctrl+``.
   - Navigate to the directory where your C file is saved using the `cd` command.
   - Compile your C program using the appropriate compiler command. For example:
     ```
     gcc hello.c -o hello
     ```
     This command compiles `hello.c` into an executable named `hello`.
   - Run your program by typing `./hello` in the terminal and pressing Enter.

8. **Debugging**:
   - You can debug your C program using the built-in debugger in VS Code. Set breakpoints by clicking on the left margin of the code editor or by pressing `F9` on the line you want to break at. Then, start debugging by clicking on the "Run and Debug" button in the sidebar, or by pressing `F5`.

That's it! You should now have a working setup for C programming in Visual Studio Code.
